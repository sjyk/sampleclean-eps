\section{Problem Statement}
In this section, we formalize the problem explored in this paper.
We are given a set of ER operators,
each of which is a heuristic that is it has some probability of failure or false result.
Furthermore, these probabilities are order dependent.
Ideally, we would like to find the order that minimizes error; however, without ground
truth data this is a difficult objective.
Instead, in this work, we look to find execution orders that are guaranteed not to be too bad.
While not optimal, these can be proven to be close to the expected error the the pipeline.

\subsection{Problem 1. Robust Execution of A Collection of ER Operations}
Given as input a collection of ER operations, and a relation $R$:
\[P = \{\kappa_1, \kappa_2,...,\delta_1,\delta_2\} \]
Let $\mathbb{O}$ be the set of all total orders over P, and $P_o(R)$ be the execution
of the pipeline with a specific total order $o\in \mathbb{O}$.
Let $N(P_o(R))$ be a measure of the error rate of that order of operations.

The output of ESP is some operation $T$ which such that the error rate of applying 
T(R) is close to that of the expected error rate for the pipeline:
\[ \mid N(T(R)) - \mathbb{E}(N(P_o(R))) \mid \le \epsilon w.h.p \ \]
